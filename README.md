🎮 Video Game Hit vs. Non-Hit Classification (Machine Learning)
Project Overview

This project investigates whether video games can be classified as “Hit” or “Non-Hit” based on their attributes using supervised machine learning models. Leveraging global video game sales and metadata, the analysis focuses on identifying patterns and features that contribute to a game’s popularity.

The project was completed as part of a Machine Learning course in the Master of Science in Business Analytics program and emphasizes both predictive performance and interpretability for business decision-making.
