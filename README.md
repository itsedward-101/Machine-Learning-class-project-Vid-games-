Project Proposal
Dataset:
● The “Discovering Hidden Trends in Global Video Games” dataset from Kaggle contains
worldwide video game sales data categorized by title, platform, genre, publisher, year of
release, and region. It allows analysis of sales patterns across time and geography. It has
a 10/10 score for usability and was recently published 3 years ago. There are 1907 data
points total in this dataset. The target of this dataset is to understand what trends make
global video games popular so that developers can cater to the current audience in the
video game sphere.

Questions:
● Can video games be classified as a “hit” or “non-hit” based on their attributes?
○ The Review column will be used to consider if the game is a “Hit” or “non-hit”
○ A “hit game” will have a review of 75 or higher, while anything lower will be
considered a “non-hit” (using the Metacritic rating system)
Potential Analytical Approach:
● Logistic Regression: Would help find how each attribute (i.e., genre, platform, or
publisher) affects the chance of a game being a “hit” (review score ≥ 75).
● Naive Bayes: Would use probabilities to predict if a game is a hit, based on its different
attributes.
● Decision Trees: Would split the data into “hit” and “non-hit” categories, to show how
different attributes lead to a game being a hit or not.
● Random Forest: Would combine many decision trees to make more accurate predictions
and avoid relying on just one tree.
